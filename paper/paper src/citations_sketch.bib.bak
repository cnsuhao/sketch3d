  number = {3},
  abstract = {With the advent of sketch-based methods for shape construction, there's
	a new degree of power available in the rapid creation of approximate
	shapes. Sketch [Zeleznik, 1996] showed how a gesture-based modeler
	could be used to simplify conventional CSG-like shape creation. Teddy
	[Igarashi, 1999] extended this to more free-form models, getting
	much of its power from its ``inflation'' operation (which converted
	a simple closed curve in the plane into a 3D shape whose silhouette,
	from the current point of view, was that curve on the view plane)
	and from an elegant collection of gestures for attaching additional
	parts to a shape, cutting a shape, and deforming it.
	
	But despite the powerful collection of tools in Teddy, the underlying
	polygonal representation of shapes intrudes on the results in many
	places. In this paper, we discuss our preliminary efforts at using
	variational implicit surfaces [Turk, 2000] as a representation in
	a free-form modeler. We also discuss the implementation of several
	operations within this context, and a collection of user-interaction
	elements that work well together to make modeling interesting hierarchies
	simple. These include ``stroke inflation'' via implicit functions,
	blob-merging, automatic hierarchy construction, and local surface
	modification via silhouette oversketching. We demonstrate our results
	by creating several models.},

  abstract = {There is growing interest in developing tools with which novice users
	can create detailed 3D models of their own designs. The most popular
	approaches to this problem include sketch-based interfaces and part-composition
	systems. The sketch-based modeling systems provide natural interfaces
	for creating 3D models from 2D sketches, but are generally limited
	to creating simple geometric models. The part-composition systems
	provide tools for combining parts extracted from a database of 3D
	models, and thus can generate very detailed 3D models, but usually
	with much higher overhead and expertise required by the user for
	manipulating 3D geometry interactively. In this paper, we introduce
	a new modeling method that overcomes these limitations by combining
	both approaches ? we introduce a modeling system for parts composition
	with a sketching interface. The system allows the user to find a
	part in a database and composite it into a model with a single sketch.
	This approach combines the benefits of both approaches ? i.e., it
	allows creation of highly detailed models/scenes (as details come
	from parts in the database), while 2D sketched strokes provide all
	the information for part selection and composition (no 3D manipulation
	is required, in general). To enable this modeling method, we investigate
	an algorithm for 3D shape search with 2D sketch as a shape query
	and a part placement algorithm which automatically orients, translates,
	scales, and attaches a new part into a modeling scene by taking the
	user sketch as a hint. User experiences with our prototype system
	show that novice users can create interesting and detailed models
	with our system.},

  abstract = {We present a new sketch-based modeling approach in which models are
	interactively designed by drawing their 2D silhouettes from different
	views. The core idea of our paper is to limit the input to 2D silhouettes,
	removing the need to explicitly create or position 3D elements. Arbitrarily
	complex models can be constructed by assembling them out of parts
	defined by their silhouettes, which can be combined using CSG operations.
	We introduce a new simplified algorithm to compute CSG solids that
	leverages special properties of silhouette cylinders to convert the
	3D CSG problem into one that can be handled entirely with 2D operations,
	making implementation simpler and more robust. We evaluate our approach
	by modeling a random sampling of man-made objects taken from the
	words in WordNet, and show that all of the tested man-made objects
	can be modeled quickly and easily using our approach.},

  abstract = {We present an image guided pen-based suggestive interface for sketching
	3D wireframe models. Rather than starting from a blank canvas, existing
	2D images of similar objects serve as a guide to the user. Image
	based filters enable attraction, smoothing, and resampling of input
	curves, and allows for their selective application using pinning
	and gluing techniques. New input strokes also invoke suggestions
	of relevant geometry that can be used, reducing the need to explicitly
	draw all parts of the new model. All suggestions appear in-place
	with the model being built, in the user's focal attention space.
	A curve matching algorithm seamlessly augments basic suggestions
	with more complex ones from a database populated with previously
	used geometry. The interface also incorporates gestural command input,
	and interaction techniques for camera controls that enable smooth
	transitions between orthographic and perspective views.},
